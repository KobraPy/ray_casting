1) Teste if is possible to correct the values in pygame.Vector after
the calculation to see if isnt necessary to use a function to this.

2)Understand how (t) and (u) in intersection function works

3) Right now the script is drawing all the line that intersct even if they subscribe eachother
Using distance between two points, calcule the smallest line to be draw.
